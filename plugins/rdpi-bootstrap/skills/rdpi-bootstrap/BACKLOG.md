# RDPI Bootstrap — Backlog

Open questions, unresolved items, and future improvements. Items move to SPEC.md when resolved or to DECISIONS.md when a decision is made.

---

## Unresolved from Spec (Open Questions)

### ~~B-001: Skill Registration Mechanism~~ → Resolved in D-013
Generated skills go to `.claude/skills/` (auto-discovered). Three options: project-local (default), global, existing plugin.

### B-002: Missing Phase Artifacts
What happens when a phase skill is invoked but previous phase artifacts are missing? Options: error with guidance, or offer to run the missing phase.

---

## Unspecified Details

### B-003: MANIFEST.md Format
MANIFEST.md is mentioned as "Navigation index with status of each phase" but the format is undefined. Questions:
- What statuses? (pending / in-progress / complete / skipped)
- Who writes it? (each skill appends its section)
- Is it machine-readable or just for humans?

### B-004: Resume After Interruption
What if a user interrupts a phase midway and restarts? Strategy needed:
- Implement: read `implementation-log.md` and continue from last completed slice
- Design: re-read `design.md` draft if it exists
- Research: re-read `questions.md` if questions were already formulated
- General: each skill should check for existing partial artifacts on start

### B-005: Agent Discovery Mechanism
"Enumerate all agents and skills available" — but how? Options:
- Parse `system-reminder` messages in context for available skills/agents
- Glob `plugins/*/agents/*.md` and `plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- Use `ToolSearch` tool
- Read `.claude/settings.json` for registered plugins
- Some combination of the above

### B-006: End-to-End Example
No concrete example of the full flow from ticket to PR. Adding one would make the spec much more tangible. Should cover:
- A medium-complexity feature (standard depth)
- All 4 phases with sample artifacts
- The actual commands the user types

### B-007: Bug Fixing Flow — Concrete Differences
Scope says "Bug fixing workflow (adapted RDPI — lighter Design, focused Research)" but never specifies HOW. Proposed:
- Research: Questions focus on reproduction, root cause, affected areas
- Design: always Light depth (ADR + "why fix it this way")
- Plan: typically single phase
- Complexity assessment: likely recommends skipping Design

---

## Future Improvements

### B-008: Team Workflow
From devil's advocate (D-13): after Design phase, optionally share design with code owners for pre-alignment before proceeding to Plan. Bootstrap asks solo/team but doesn't operationalize the difference.

### B-009: "Go Back and Forth With Me" as Literal Phrase
User requested this phrase be literally present in the meta-skill and in the generated Research skill. Currently captured as Principle 4 but not as a literal instruction in the skill template.

### B-010: Refactoring / Migration Workflows
Currently out of scope. When added:
- Refactoring: Research focused on impact analysis, Design on before/after patterns
- Migration: Research on source/target systems, Design on migration strategy + rollback

### B-011: Big Picture Agent — Related Ticket Context
After reading a ticket by ID, the Research phase should spawn a sub-agent that builds the "big picture":
- Read the current ticket plus related tickets (parent, siblings, children)
- Check the artifacts directory for existing implementations of related tickets
- Summarize: what's already done, what's in progress, how the current ticket fits into the broader initiative
This gives the agent context on dependencies, prior decisions, and potential conflicts before diving into research.

### B-018: Structured Introduction + Closing Pattern for rdpi-bootstrap

The skill execution should follow this pattern:

**1. Opening — show intro immediately (before any questions)**
Show the two-table introduction we formulated:
- Table 1: commands per phase
- Phrase: "Clear context between each phase..."
- One-sentence QRSPI explanation
- Table 2: sub-phases with who/output/user action
- Note: Design and Plan are optional based on complexity
End with: "Now I'll ask you a few questions and scan the codebase to tailor these skills to your project."

**2. Interview + research (Steps 1–4 from skill)**
Run as normal.

**3. Pre-confirm deviation summary**
Before showing the full settings confirmation table (Step 5), output a concise line if anything will differ from the default workflow shown in the intro. Examples:
- "No Deploy/Verify step — not configured for this project."
- "Design phase skipped by default — you selected Sonnet only."
- "Multi-phase delivery enabled — Plan will include slice breakdown."
If nothing differs: skip this entirely.

**4. Closing — show commands table again**
After skill generation is complete (Step 10), repeat Table 1 (commands only).
End with: "Easy to remember — it's in the name: **R**DPI. Always start with **R**: `/rdpi-research`."

**5. README.md**
The same two tables (commands + sub-phases) must also be written to `.claude/skills/README.md` (or the marketplace equivalent). This is the persistent reference — the intro shown during bootstrap is ephemeral, the README stays.

**Why this pattern works:**
- User sees the full picture before committing to the interview
- Deviations are surfaced explicitly, not buried in the settings table
- Closing table is the actionable takeaway — user has it fresh when ready to start

### B-015: Concise Communication Style
The skill must communicate tersely throughout — matching caveman-style rules from user's CLAUDE.md. Specific violations to avoid:
- Long paragraphs explaining what it's about to do
- Verbose confirmations after tool output
- Restating what the user said
Applied to: interview questions, parameter confirmation, status updates, next-step prompts.

### B-016: Workflow Outline After Settings Confirmation
After the user confirms auto-determined settings (D-014 confirm step), the skill should output a concise workflow outline showing what RDPI will look like for THIS project. Not generic docs — personalized to the confirmed settings:
- Commands the user will type per phase
- What each phase produces (artifact names, paths)
- Which phases are optional based on complexity
- Any project-specific notes (task tracker, branch format, deploy step)
Format: table or numbered list, max ~20 lines. Purpose: user sees the full picture before committing.

### B-017: Phase Skills Must Not Invoke Next Phase
Each generated phase skill must end with the next command as plain text — not invoke it. The skill should print `/rdpi-design ./rdpi/{folder}` and stop. It must never call `Skill` tool or otherwise trigger the next phase automatically. User runs the next command in a fresh session.

### B-019: Re-run Prompt After Bootstrap Completion
After skill generation is complete, add this line:
"If anything in the RDPI workflow doesn't fit your needs, run `/rdpi-bootstrap <description of desired changes>` to refine it."

### B-013: Artifacts Replace Compaction — Disable Auto-Compaction
Principle 2 says artifacts replace compaction. Should the generated skills explicitly instruct Claude to avoid auto-compaction? Or is this handled by the clean-context-per-phase design?

### ~~B-014: Spec Artifact Template~~ → Partially resolved
`RDPI_SKILLS_SPEC.md` template defined in SPEC.md (Registration + Parameter Provenance sections). Research phase `spec.md` template still needs definition (requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints, out of scope, complexity assessment).
