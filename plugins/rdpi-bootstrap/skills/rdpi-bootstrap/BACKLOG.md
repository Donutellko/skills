# RDPI Bootstrap — Backlog

Open questions, unresolved items, and future improvements. Items move to SPEC.md when resolved or to DECISIONS.md when a decision is made.

---

## Unresolved from Spec (Open Questions)

### ~~B-001: Skill Registration Mechanism~~ → Resolved in D-013
Generated skills go to `.claude/skills/` (auto-discovered). Three options: project-local (default), global, existing plugin.

### B-002: Missing Phase Artifacts
What happens when a phase skill is invoked but previous phase artifacts are missing? Options: error with guidance, or offer to run the missing phase.

---

## Unspecified Details

### B-003: MANIFEST.md Format
MANIFEST.md is mentioned as "Navigation index with status of each phase" but the format is undefined. Questions:
- What statuses? (pending / in-progress / complete / skipped)
- Who writes it? (each skill appends its section)
- Is it machine-readable or just for humans?

### B-004: Resume After Interruption
What if a user interrupts a phase midway and restarts? Strategy needed:
- Implement: read `implementation-log.md` and continue from last completed slice
- Design: re-read `design.md` draft if it exists
- Research: re-read `questions.md` if questions were already formulated
- General: each skill should check for existing partial artifacts on start

### B-005: Agent Discovery Mechanism
"Enumerate all agents and skills available" — but how? Options:
- Parse `system-reminder` messages in context for available skills/agents
- Glob `plugins/*/agents/*.md` and `plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- Use `ToolSearch` tool
- Read `.claude/settings.json` for registered plugins
- Some combination of the above

### B-006: End-to-End Example
No concrete example of the full flow from ticket to PR. Adding one would make the spec much more tangible. Should cover:
- A medium-complexity feature (standard depth)
- All 4 phases with sample artifacts
- The actual commands the user types

### B-007: Bug Fixing Flow — Concrete Differences
Scope says "Bug fixing workflow (adapted RDPI — lighter Design, focused Research)" but never specifies HOW. Proposed:
- Research: Questions focus on reproduction, root cause, affected areas
- Design: always Light depth (ADR + "why fix it this way")
- Plan: typically single phase
- Complexity assessment: likely recommends skipping Design

---

## Future Improvements

### B-008: Team Workflow
From devil's advocate (D-13): after Design phase, optionally share design with code owners for pre-alignment before proceeding to Plan. Bootstrap asks solo/team but doesn't operationalize the difference.

### B-009: "Go Back and Forth With Me" as Literal Phrase
User requested this phrase be literally present in the meta-skill and in the generated Research skill. Currently captured as Principle 4 but not as a literal instruction in the skill template.

### B-010: Refactoring / Migration Workflows
Currently out of scope. When added:
- Refactoring: Research focused on impact analysis, Design on before/after patterns
- Migration: Research on source/target systems, Design on migration strategy + rollback

### B-011: Big Picture Agent — Related Ticket Context
After reading a ticket by ID, the Research phase should spawn a sub-agent that builds the "big picture":
- Read the current ticket plus related tickets (parent, siblings, children)
- Check the artifacts directory for existing implementations of related tickets
- Summarize: what's already done, what's in progress, how the current ticket fits into the broader initiative
This gives the agent context on dependencies, prior decisions, and potential conflicts before diving into research.

### B-018: Structured Introduction + Closing Pattern for rdpi-bootstrap

The skill execution should follow this pattern:

**1. Opening — show intro immediately (before any questions)**
Show the two-table introduction we formulated:
- Table 1: commands per phase
- Phrase: "Clear context between each phase..."
- One-sentence QRSPI explanation
- Table 2: sub-phases with who/output/user action
- Note: Design and Plan are optional based on complexity
End with: "Now I'll ask you a few questions and scan the codebase to tailor these skills to your project."

**2. Interview + research (Steps 1–4 from skill)**
Run as normal.

**3. Pre-confirm deviation summary**
Before showing the full settings confirmation table (Step 5), output a concise line if anything will differ from the default workflow shown in the intro. Examples:
- "No Deploy/Verify step — not configured for this project."
- "Design phase skipped by default — you selected Sonnet only."
- "Multi-phase delivery enabled — Plan will include slice breakdown."
If nothing differs: skip this entirely.

**4. Closing — show commands table again**
After skill generation is complete (Step 10), repeat Table 1 (commands only).
End with: "Easy to remember — it's in the name: **R**DPI. Always start with **R**: `/rdpi-research`."

**5. README.md**
The same two tables (commands + sub-phases) must also be written to `.claude/skills/README.md` (or the marketplace equivalent). This is the persistent reference — the intro shown during bootstrap is ephemeral, the README stays.

**Why this pattern works:**
- User sees the full picture before committing to the interview
- Deviations are surfaced explicitly, not buried in the settings table
- Closing table is the actionable takeaway — user has it fresh when ready to start

### B-015: Concise Communication Style
The skill must communicate tersely throughout — matching caveman-style rules from user's CLAUDE.md. Specific violations to avoid:
- Long paragraphs explaining what it's about to do
- Verbose confirmations after tool output
- Restating what the user said
Applied to: interview questions, parameter confirmation, status updates, next-step prompts.

### ~~B-016: Workflow Outline After Settings Confirmation~~ → Resolved by B-018
After the user confirms auto-determined settings (D-014 confirm step), the skill should output a concise workflow outline showing what RDPI will look like for THIS project. Not generic docs — personalized to the confirmed settings:
- Commands the user will type per phase
- What each phase produces (artifact names, paths)
- Which phases are optional based on complexity
- Any project-specific notes (task tracker, branch format, deploy step)
Format: table or numbered list, max ~20 lines. Purpose: user sees the full picture before committing.

### B-017: Phase Skills Must Not Invoke Next Phase
Each generated phase skill must end with the next command as plain text — not invoke it. The skill should print `/rdpi-design ./rdpi/{folder}` and stop. It must never call `Skill` tool or otherwise trigger the next phase automatically. User runs the next command in a fresh session.

### B-019: Re-run Prompt After Bootstrap Completion
After skill generation is complete, add this line:
"If anything in the RDPI workflow doesn't fit your needs, run `/rdpi-bootstrap <description of desired changes>` to refine it."

### B-020: Branch Format Missing from Confirm Table
Branch naming convention is auto-detected in Step 3 but never shown in the Step 5 confirmation table. Add it:
```
Branch format:   feature/{ticket-number}-{short-name}    (auto-detected: git log / default)
```
Default if not detectable from git log: `feature/{ticket-number}-{short-name}`. Also write to `RDPI_SKILLS_SPEC.md` under Discovered Conventions and pass into generated phase skills (Implement phase uses it for branch creation).

### B-021: Extract and Surface Useful Instructions from Existing Project Skills
Step 1 already discovers existing skills like `implement-feature`, `implement-story`, `implement-spec`. Currently just "extract useful context" with no further spec. This needs to be concrete:

**What to do:**
- Read each discovered project-specific skill
- Extract: coding conventions, quality gates, agent usage patterns, workflow constraints, project-specific rules
- Write extracted items to `RDPI_SKILLS_SPEC.md` under a new "Inherited from Existing Skills" section
- Show a concise summary to the user in the confirm step (Step 5):
  ```
  Inherited from existing skills:
    implement-feature:   uses wsbaser:code-simplifier after each slice
    implement-story:     requires GHA CI green before PR ready
    ...
  ```
- Incorporate relevant extracted instructions into the generated phase skills

**Why:** Existing skills encode hard-won project conventions. Ignoring them means regenerating rules that are already known.

### B-024: Simpler Command Format — Task ID Instead of Folder Path
Current commands after Research are unfriendly:
```
/rdpi-design ./rdpi/2026-04-06-US1234-fix-login
```
New format — user passes Task ID or short name, skill resolves the folder:
```
/rdpi-research US1234-fix-login
/rdpi-design US1234
/rdpi-plan US1234
/rdpi-implement US1234
```
Each phase skill:
1. Accepts a Task ID or description as argument (not a folder path)
2. Resolves the artifact folder by globbing `./rdpi/*{task-id}*/` — picks the most recent match
3. If ambiguous (multiple matches), lists them and asks the user to confirm
4. If no match found for Design/Plan/Implement, errors with: "No artifact folder found for '{arg}'. Run /rdpi-research first."

Update in: SKILL.md Step 0 intro table, all 4 phase templates (references/), SPEC.md phase descriptions.

### B-025: Generated Phase Skill Descriptions Must Be Human-Facing
RDPI phase skills are invoked by the user, not auto-triggered by LLM. The `description:` field in each generated SKILL.md frontmatter should be short and human-readable — not a trigger-detection prompt.

Proposed descriptions:
- **rdpi-research:** Human part first: "Start your task implementation. Paste the ticket ID or description and answer questions. Produces: `spec.md`." Then LLM trigger part appended (not human-readable): auto-trigger when user pastes issue ID, ticket number, or describes a task to implement.
- **rdpi-design:** "Define what to build. Reviews spec, interactive design session. Produces: `structure-outline.md` (review required)." — human-invoked only, no auto-trigger.
- **rdpi-plan:** "Convert design into execution plan. Produces: `plan.md` + brief summary for you to review." — human-invoked only.
- **rdpi-implement:** "Execute the plan. Runs code, creates Draft PR. Review first slice + final PR." — human-invoked only.

Description format: human-readable sentence first, LLM trigger keywords appended after a separator (e.g. a blank line or `---`) so it doesn't appear in UI but is still parsed by the model.

Also applies to `rdpi-bootstrap` itself — one-time setup skill, no auto-trigger.

Update in: all 4 phase templates (`references/`), and the bootstrap SKILL.md description field.

### B-022: Multi-Service Scope Question
In monorepos with multiple independent services (e.g. 7 agents each with their own Makefile, pyproject.toml, CLAUDE.md), bootstrap must ask: "Which service(s) will you use RDPI for?" before generating skills. Generated skills must be scoped to a specific service root — not repo root — so `make check`, `make tests`, and file paths resolve correctly.
**What to detect:** multiple `pyproject.toml` or `Makefile` files at depth >1 → trigger the question.
**Output:** write chosen service path(s) to RDPI_SKILLS_SPEC.md. Generated skills use that path as working root.

### B-023: Missing Fields in Confirm Table
Add to Step 5 confirmation table:
```
Branch format:   feature/US{id}-{short-name}     (auto-detected: git log / CLAUDE.md)
Commit style:    type: message                    (auto-detected: git log)
Ticket format:   US{id}                           (auto-detected: CLAUDE.md / Rally)
Quality gate:    ruff + mypy + pytest + cov ≥30%  (auto-detected: Makefile)
```
Branch format default if not detectable: `feature/{ticket-id}-{short-name}`.
All four fields written to RDPI_SKILLS_SPEC.md under Discovered Conventions.

### B-026: Pre-Branch Git State Check in Implement

Before creating a feature branch, the generated `rdpi-implement` skill must check git state:

1. **Current branch** — must be on `main`. If not, warn and ask user if they want to switch.
2. **Uncommitted changes** (`git status --short`) — if any, stop and ask: commit, stash, or discard?
3. **Unpushed commits** (`git log @{u}..HEAD --oneline`) — if any, notify and ask: push first or proceed?
4. **Sync with remote** (`git fetch origin main` + compare) — if behind, pull automatically. If ahead or diverged, notify and ask.

Only after all checks pass: `git checkout -b feature/{task-id}-{short-description}`.

Update in: generated `rdpi-implement` skill template (`references/implement-template.md`), Step 1: Branch Setup.

### B-013: Artifacts Replace Compaction — Disable Auto-Compaction
Principle 2 says artifacts replace compaction. Should the generated skills explicitly instruct Claude to avoid auto-compaction? Or is this handled by the clean-context-per-phase design?

### ~~B-014: Spec Artifact Template~~ → Partially resolved
`RDPI_SKILLS_SPEC.md` template defined in SPEC.md (Registration + Parameter Provenance sections). Research phase `spec.md` template still needs definition (requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints, out of scope, complexity assessment).

### B-029: Parallel Spec Refinement Pipeline

Replace the serial Research→Design spec loop with parallel sub-agents to collapse multi-session v4→v5-style refinement into a single session:

1. **Drafter** sub-agent writes initial spec to `spec-draft.md` from the research brief
2. **Devil's advocate** sub-agent reads the draft, writes critical review + alternative approaches to `spec-review.md`
3. **Reconciler** sub-agent reads both files, merges the best ideas, flags unresolved trade-offs, writes final `spec.md`

Only unresolved trade-offs surface to the user for a decision.

**Why:** Iterative spec refinement (e.g. bootstrap v4→v5) requires multiple back-and-forth sessions. Parallel sub-agents simulate the same adversarial review in one shot, surfacing only genuine decision points.

**Where:** Research phase — after blind research sub-agent completes, before presenting spec to user. Enable by default for Complex tasks; optional for Medium.

---

### B-028: Open Structure/Outline in VS Code After Generation

After the sub-agent writes `structure-outline.md`, the design skill should automatically open it in VS Code:
```
code <path>/02-design/structure-outline.md
```
So the user can review it without having to navigate to the file manually.

---

### B-030: Research Agent Should Proactively Search context7 for Documentation

During the Research phase, the generated `rdpi-research` skill should instruct the agent to use the `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` and `mcp__context7__query-docs` MCP tools when the feature involves any library, framework, SDK, API, or CLI tool — even well-known ones like React, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Celery, etc. This prevents the agent from relying on potentially stale training data and ensures research is grounded in current docs.

**What to add:** In the Research phase skill template (`references/research-template.md`), add an explicit step: "For each library or framework identified during research, query context7 for current documentation before forming conclusions."

**When to trigger:** Any time a library import, framework name, or external API is mentioned in the ticket or discovered during codebase scan.

---

### B-031: Single qdi-work Skill with Persistent rdpi/ Folder Awareness

Shift from multiple discrete skills (rdpi-research, rdpi-design, rdpi-plan, rdpi-implement) to a single comprehensive `qdi-work skill that:
- Accepts a single command for the entire QDI (Question, Design, Implement) workflow
- Has Claude remain in the same session throughout execution
- At any point, the agent is aware of the entire rdpi/ folder structure and contents
- Maintains context of previous phases' outputs even if the user doesn't explicitly call the current phase

**Why:** Multi-skill handoffs lose context between sessions. A single persistent session with full rdpi/ awareness ensures coherent decision-making and prevents context fragmentation.

**How:** 
- Research phase reads existing rdpi/ subfolders as context before starting
- Implements "context carry" - previous phase outputs automatically available
- Agent doesn't need to re-read completed artifacts for subsequent phases

---

### B-027: Structure/Outline Sub-agent Prompt Produces Over-detailed Output

The sub-agent prompt in `rdpi-design` SKILL.md generates structure outlines that are as large or larger than the design doc itself. Root causes:

1. Item 5 in the prompt explicitly invites code: `"include them (like C header files — signatures, not implementation)"` — sub-agent interprets this as licence to include full function signatures, dataclass definitions, YAML schemas, pyproject.toml snippets, and Makefile targets.
2. No explicit prohibition on code blocks, schemas, or config.
3. "Diagrams in Mermaid format where helpful" produces per-slice diagrams, not just one overview.

**Fix:**
- Remove item 5 (signatures invitation) entirely — signatures belong in the Plan phase.
- Replace with: `"NO code, signatures, schemas, or config snippets. Each slice: files changed (create/edit) + 3-5 test bullets only."`
- Change diagram instruction to: `"One Mermaid data-flow diagram for the whole feature if the wiring is non-obvious. No per-slice diagrams."`

**Location to fix:** `rdpi-design` SKILL.md, Step 2 sub-agent prompt (the triple-backtick block).
